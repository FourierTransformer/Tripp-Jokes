# Tripp Jokes
Rules to the card game Tripp Jokes

## Setup
For 2-3 players: 1 deck of cards with Jokers

For 4-6 players: 2 decks of cards with all Jokers

There are 4 SPECIAL types of cards used throughout the game, and are explained in How To Play:

1. The 2's: WILD cards
2. The 3's: SELF-SKIP cards
3. The 10's: CLEAR cards
4. The Jokers: PICKUP cards

## Object of the Game
The goal of Tripp Jokes is to get rid of all your cards before everyone else.

## Course of the Game
### Setup
A dealer is chosen at random. The dealer should shuffle all cards (from both decks, if using multiple decks) together and deal 9 cards face down to each player. Players are not allowed to initially look at their cards. The deck is then placed face down on the table, and the topmost card is flipped over to start the FACEUP PILE.  Each player chooses 3 cards at random (without knowing what they are) as their FINAL cards and places them facedown infront of themsleves.  Players may now look at the remaining 6 cards in their hands and choose 3 to place down faceup on the FINAL cards. If this is the first time playing the game, playing SPECIAL cards or high valued cards (face cards) is a good strategy. The remaining 3 cards are the player's HAND CARDS and should not be shown to anyone else.

At the start of the game, the player to the dealer's right is the first to play.

### Turns
The current player picks a HAND card that matches or exceeds the value of topmost card in the FACEUP PILE. In Trip Jokes, Aces are high. The current player can play multiples of the same card as long as they are in HAND and played at the same time. If, at any point, there are three consecutive cards in the FACEUP PILE of the same type, the entire FACEUP PILE is moved to the DISCARD pile and the current player can play any card.
