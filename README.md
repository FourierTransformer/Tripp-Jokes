# Tripp Jokes
Rules to the card game Tripp Jokes

## Setup
For 2-3 players: 1 deck of cards with Jokers

For 4-6 players: 2 decks of cards with all Jokers

There are 4 SPECIAL types of cards used throughout the game, and are explained in How To Play:

1. The 2's: WILD cards
2. The 3's: SELF-SKIP cards
3. The 10's: CLEAR cards
4. The Jokers: PICKUP cards

## Object of the Game
The goal of Tripp Jokes is to get rid of all your cards before everyone else.

## Course of the Game
### Setup
A dealer is chosen at random. The dealer should shuffle all cards (from both decks, if using multiple decks) together and deal 9 cards face down to each player. Players are not allowed to initially look at their cards. The deck is then placed FACEDOWN on the table, and the topmost card is flipped over to start the FACEUP PILE.  Each player chooses 3 cards at random (without knowing what they are) as their FINAL cards and places them facedown infront of themsleves.  Players may now look at the remaining 6 cards in their hands and choose 3 to place down faceup on the FINAL cards. These are the PENULTIMATE cards. If this is the first time playing the game, playing SPECIAL cards or high valued cards (face cards) is a good strategy. The remaining 3 cards are the player's HAND CARDS and should not be shown to anyone else.

At the start of the game, the player to the dealer's right is the first to play.

### Turns
The current player picks a HAND card that matches or exceeds the value of the topmost card in the FACEUP PILE. In Trip Jokes, Aces are high. Alteratively, a SPECIAL card can be played during the player's turn (explained below). The current player can play multiples of the same card as long as they are in HAND and played at the same time. If, at any point, there are three consecutive cards in the FACEUP PILE of the same type, the entire FACEUP PILE is moved to the DISCARD pile and the current player can play any card.

If the player is unable to match or exceed the topmost card, and don't have a SPECIAL card to play, they must pick up the FACEUP PILE and add it to their HAND. If a player can only play a SPECIAL card, they must play it. 

If the player now has fewer than 3 cards in HAND, they must draw cards from the FACEDOWN deck until they have 3 cards in hand. If the player has 3 or more cards, nothing needs to be drawn. This ends the players turn and play is continued clockwise.

### Special Cards
1. The 2's: WILD cards. When a 2 is played, any other card from the current player's HAND can be played on top of it.
2. The 3's: SELF-SKIP cards. When a 3 is played, the following player has to play to the previous card in the FACEUP PILE - effectively skipping the current player's turn.
3. The 10's: CLEAR cards. After a 10 is played, the FACEUP PILE is moved to the DISCARD pile and the current player can play another card from their HAND.
4. The Jokers: PICKUP cards. If a Joker is played, the current player adds the FACEUP pile to their HAND cards and the Joker is left behind.

## End of Game
When the FACEUP PILE is exhausted, player's will play with whatever cards are in HAND, until none remain. Then they are allowed to play from the PENULTIMATE cards. If the current player is exhausting their HAND cards and has a matching card (or many) in the PENULTIMATE cards, they are allowed to play them at the same time. If a player's HAND cards are exhausted with the SPECIAL cards 2 or 10, they can play a card from the PENULTIMATE cards on their current turn.

If the current player has no more PENULTIMATE cards, they must randomly choose a FINAL card to play. The card must be shown to everyone and if it doesn't match or exceed the topmost card in the FACEUP PILE, the FACEUP PILE should be added to the player's HAND.

Also, if the PENULTIMATE cards are exhausted by playing a 2 or 10, a FINAL card can be chosen at random to play on the player's turn.
